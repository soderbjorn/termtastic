 * [WindowSocket] is an interface so the transport can be swapped:

 *     (created via [LunamuxClient.openWindowSocket]);
 *   - [se.soderbjorn.lunamux.client.demo.DemoWindowSocket] answers from

 *
 * The file-browser and git round-trips are default implementations on the
 * interface: they only need [send] + [envelopes], so every transport gets
 * them for free.
