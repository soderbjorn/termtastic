/**
 * The **other-world command center** — the destination you reach by flying the camera *through*
 * a wormhole like a spaceship. It is deliberately **not** a separate scene: the destination is
 * the *very same* rotunda of tabs/panes, re-skinned to the next world's theme, so it reads as
 * "the same command center, elsewhere." What changes on arrival is the **sky** (the destination
 * world's deep-space colour), the pane **chrome/accent** ([spikeChrome] resolves the destination
 * theme while a transit previews it), and a small arrival **banner** naming the world.
 *
 * Unlike the original prototype — which toggled between the home world and a single hardcoded
 * "Amber CRT" duplicate — this ports the look & feel onto the real multi-world support: ⌥⌘O
 * **cycles the active world** on to the next [WorldConfig] in [WindowConfig.worlds] (wrapping
 * after the last), by sending [WindowCommand.SetActiveWorld] at the tunnel midpoint. The server
 * re-broadcasts the config and the client auto-repaints to the destination world's theme pair
 * via [applyActiveWorldTheme]; to make the mid-tunnel swap crisp (hidden behind the opaque
 * canvas) we *also* preview the destination theme client-side ([spikeWorldThemePreview]) so the
 * re-skin lands before the round-trip completes.
 *
 * The journey ([enterOrExitOtherWorld] → [tickWorldTransit]) is a four-leg cinematic —
 * **open** (rift blooms ahead, camera winds back), **approach** (charge into the rift),
 * **tunnel** (a few seconds riding a high-tech light tunnel — [drawTransitTunnel] — with the
 * palette swapping at its midpoint), **arrive** (fly forward across the new world to the
 * command center). The rift reuses the spawn wormhole's [buildWormholeVortex]; the tunnel is
 * a full-screen 2D canvas in the same screen-space idiom as the phaser / warp-core passes.

/**
 * One in-flight world transit: the reused wormhole vortex (leg 1–2), the full-screen tunnel
 * canvas + its particle fields (leg 3), and the screen flash for the threshold punches, plus
 * the clock [tickWorldTransit] advances the whole fly-through with. At most one runs at a
 * time. Created by [enterOrExitOtherWorld]; disposed by [clearWorldTransit].
 *
 * @property group the vortex disc `Group` (billboarded + tilted + scaled while it's shown).
 * @property rings the two vortex cloud-layer `<div>`s, spun for the churn.
 * @property twists each vortex cloud layer's fixed pre-rotation (radians).
 * @property flash the vortex's own eye-flash element (unused here; kept off).
 * @property elements the vortex disc wrapper element(s) — for the open fade + teardown.
 * @property screenFlash the full-screen white `<div>` pulsed at the two thresholds (enter/exit).
 * @property canvas the full-screen tunnel canvas (opacity carries the tunnel fade in/out).
 * @property ctx the tunnel canvas 2D context.
 * @property streakAng/[streakRad]/[streakSpd] the warp-streak field (fixed angle, growing
 *   radius, per-streak speed) — the light lines rushing outward past the ship.
 * @property ringDepth/[ringRot] the tunnel-ring field (0..1 depth rushing toward the viewer,
 *   fixed rotation) — the structural hoops of the tube.
 * @property destinationWorldId the id of the world we're cycling to — sent as
 *   [WindowCommand.SetActiveWorld] at the tunnel midpoint (`null` when there is no distinct next
 *   world, e.g. fewer than two worlds; the transit then just replays returning to the same world).
 * @property destinationSelection the destination world's theme pair, previewed client-side at the
 *   midpoint ([spikeWorldThemePreview]) so the re-skin lands before the server round-trip.
 * @property destName the destination world's display name, shown in the arrival banner.
 * @property fromColor the tube-glow RGB of the sky we **left** (the departure world's sky).
 * @property toColor the tube-glow RGB of the sky we're **arriving** in (the destination world's
 *   sky). The tunnel fades [fromColor] → [toColor] across the ride, so it visibly connects the
 *   two skies. Both captured once at arming (from the world themes) via [skyGlowRgb].
 * @property resumeFlight whether we were in **free flight** ([spikeFlyMode]) when the warp began,
 *   so the arrival can hand the camera back in the same mode: free flight resumes parked at the
 *   new command center (fly on from there), command center lands pristine. The transit is a camera
 *   move between worlds, never a mode change. @see tickWorldTransit
 * @property startX/[startY]/[startZ] the camera **position** at the moment the warp was armed (the
 *   live free-flight pose, or the command-center home pose if not flown). The open leg eases from
 *   here to the wind-up point, so warping from anywhere in free flight glides off smoothly instead
 *   of snapping to the command center first.
 * @property lookStartX/[lookStartY]/[lookStartZ] the point the camera was **facing** at arm time
 *   (a point out along its nose, or the origin in the command center), eased toward the rift over
 *   the open leg so the turn-to-face-the-rift is smooth too.
 * @property phase elapsed 60fps-frames since arming — the master clock.
 * @property spin accumulated vortex cloud spin (radians).
 * @property tunnelRoll accumulated tunnel bank (radians), for the inside-the-tube sway.
 * @property tunnelTravel accumulated distance travelled down the tube (advanced by the ride
 *   `speed`), the clock the wandering *spine* is sampled against so the pipe's soft turns flow
 *   toward the viewer as you fly. @see drawTransitTunnel @see WORLD_TRANSIT_TUNNEL_BEND_RATE
 * @property reskinned `true` once [applyWorldPalette] has fired (at the tunnel midpoint).

 * Renders one frame of the **high-tech light tunnel** onto the transit canvas: a dark tube
 * glowing at its vanishing centre, warp **streaks** rushing outward past the ship, structural
 * **hoop rings** rushing toward the viewer, and a bright core at the end of the tube — the
 * whole field banking gently so it feels like flying *through* it. Advances the particle
 * fields in place (recycling any that pass the viewer) and colours everything by fading from
 * the sky we left ([WorldTransit.fromColor]) toward the sky we're arriving in ([toColor]) via
 * [colorT], so the tube visibly connects the two worlds' skies.
 *
 * The tube is not straight: a wandering **spine** ([spineX]/[spineY]) bends it into a pipe system
 * that makes soft turns in every direction (left/right *and* up/down) as you fly. The spine is a
 * vanishing point that drifts along a smooth, non-repeating sum-of-sines path; every element is
 * displaced by the spine according to how far *ahead* it sits down the tube, so the far end swings
 * off to one side (a bend rounding away) while whatever is right at the viewer stays dead ahead.
 * The bends flow toward you as [WorldTransit.tunnelTravel] advances with the ride `speed`.
 *
 * @param wt the transit whose canvas + particle fields to draw and advance.
 * @param colorT 0 = the departure sky's glow, 1 = the arrival sky's glow (linearly blended;
 *   streaks whiten toward the rim regardless). @see WorldTransit.fromColor @see skyGlowRgb
 * @param speed rush multiplier (streak growth + ring advance), 0 at the mouths, peak mid-tube.
 * @param shake 0..1 violence — how hard the whole tube lurches up/down/sideways and rolls
 *   back and forth (jittered per-frame so the passage reads as rough and irregular).
