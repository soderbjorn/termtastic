/**
 * Per-platform [HttpClient] factory with TLS fingerprint pinning (TOFU).
 *
 * Each Kotlin Multiplatform target supplies an `actual` implementation that
 * wires its native HTTP engine (OkHttp on Android, Darwin on iOS, CIO on the
 * JVM, browser fetch on JS) and installs a custom trust callback used for
 * SSH-style Trust-On-First-Use certificate pinning.
 *
 * Two operating modes, selected by whether [createPinnedHttpClient] is given a
 * pinned fingerprint:
 *
 *  - **Capture** (`pinnedFingerprintHex == null`): no chain validation. The
 *    leaf cert's SHA-256 is computed, exposed via [onPeerCertCaptured], and
 *    persisted by the caller off the network thread. Used on the very first
 *    connect to a new host, immediately before the server's
 *    `DeviceAuth.ApprovalDialog` runs.
 *  - **Verify** (`pinnedFingerprintHex != null`): the leaf's SHA-256 is
 *    constant-time compared against the pin. Mismatch aborts the handshake
 *    and (on JSSE targets) surfaces a `CertificateException` whose message
 *    starts with `"pin-mismatch:"` so the UI cause-chain match can fire a
 *    "Server certificate changed → Re-pair?" dialog. Every native target
 *    also invokes [onPinMismatch] with the observed leaf hex so UI layers
 *    that can't inspect the exception chain (iOS, where the Darwin
 *    URLSessionDelegate cancels the challenge without a marker error) have
 *    a uniform signal.
 *
 * Web/JS does not pin — the browser owns TLS verification end-to-end and
 * does not expose a hook for it. All arguments are accepted on that target
 * to keep the signature parallel, but ignored.

 *   when [pinnedFingerprintHex] is `null`). The callback runs off the network
 *   thread so callers can safely write to storage. Receives the same

 * @param onPinMismatch invoked at most once per client when a pin mismatch
 *   is detected in verify mode — i.e. [pinnedFingerprintHex] is non-null and
 *   the leaf cert's SHA-256 differs from it. Fires *before* the handshake is
 *   aborted (synchronously on the TLS thread on iOS / latched on JSSE
 *   targets). Keep the callback body O(1) — the intended use is writing to
 *   a `MutableStateFlow` so UI layers can read it after the surfaced
 *   exception. Receives the observed (not the pinned) lowercase hex SHA-256.
 * @return a configured [HttpClient]; the caller owns its lifecycle and must
 *   call `close()` to release the engine.
