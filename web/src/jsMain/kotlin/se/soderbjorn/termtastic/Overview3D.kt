/**
 * 3D tab overview for the Termtastic web/Electron frontend — the shared core.
 *
 * A task-switcher-style full-screen overlay presenting every visible tab and its
 * panes in 3D. This file owns everything **style-independent**: the cached
 * renderer / scene / camera / overlay, capturing each pane's live content into a
 * textured plane (terminal grid, file listing, git status — every pane type),
 * selection state ([ovSelected] / [ovPaneSelected]), and the open / close /
 * render-loop / input-routing lifecycle. The *spatial arrangement and motion* is
 * pluggable via [Overview3DStyle]: [CarouselStyle] (the default turning ring),
 * [RotundaStyle] (inside a cylinder), and [ExposeStyle] (real-layout → grid
 * zoom), chosen at open time from [experimental3dSwitcherStyle]. Both keyboard
 * and mouse/trackpad drive navigation (see [openOverview3d] and [ensureOverlay]).
 *
 * The carousel — described below — is the reference style; the same capture and
 * lifecycle machinery serves all three. Content is sourced directly from each
 * pane's **live** xterm.js instance in the [terminals] registry — the exact
 * buffer the visible pane renders — so no second `/pty` socket is opened and
 * the PTY is never resized (reading a buffer is size-neutral). A [ThumbSource]
 * subscribes to the live term's `onWriteParsed` and repaints on output, which
 * also drives a fading accent glow so active sessions "breathe" in the ring.
 * Sources are deduplicated per pane id in [ovSources]; one pane can feed both
 * a tab card and its pane tile.
 *
 * **Fidelity:** the **selected** (front) tab's terminal pane tiles render at
 * full fidelity — the pane's exact colored cell grid (ANSI/256/truecolor +
 * attributes + cursor) via [renderTerminalGrid] / [buildTermPalette] — while
 * the rest of the ring keeps the cheaper monochrome re-wrapped thumbnail
 * ([renderThumbnail]) for cost. [applyFidelity] promotes/demotes tiles as the
 * selection rotates.
 *
 * **Split-into-panes:** when a card settles at the front of the ring it
 * crossfades into its individual panes — one tile per pane, arranged exactly
 * per the tab's *real* layout geometry (read live from the toolkit via
 * [AppShellHandle.currentLayoutStateJson], falling back to the wire-model
 * [Pane] rectangle). The tiles ease apart, lift toward the camera, and bow
 * into a shallow inward curve (see [CURVE_K]); the tab's focused pane keeps a
 * persistent accent ring. Rotating away reassembles them into the flat card.
 *
 * Interaction model:
 *  - `←`/`→` or mouse wheel rotates the ring one card at a time.
 *  - `Enter` (or clicking the front card) activates that tab: the command is
 *    sent immediately and the camera *dives into* the card while the overlay
 *    fades, landing on the real tab.
 *  - Clicking a pane tile of the front card activates the tab AND focuses +
 *    raises that specific pane.
 *  - Clicking a non-front card rotates it to the front; clicking empty space
 *    or pressing `Esc` closes the overview.
 *
 * Theming: thumbnail colors come from the live xterm theme, the glow/halo
 * from the app accent, and the overlay backdrop gradient is derived from
 * the theme background ([applyThemedBackdrop]) so entering the 3D view
 * feels like the same app, not a different one.
 *
 * Performance: the WebGL renderer, scene, and camera are created once and
 * cached for the app's lifetime — [prewarmOverview3d] pays context creation
 * and first-shader compilation at boot, so opening the overview later is
 * just "build cards + unhide". Per-open resources (live-term subscriptions,
 * textures, tile geometry) are torn down on close. The
 * render loop traps per-frame exceptions so a single bad frame can never
 * kill the animation (a lesson learned: see [pickUserData]).
 *
 * Wired from [bootViaToolkitShell]: [registerOverview3dHotkey] binds the
 * configurable toggle chord (default ⌥⌘→) to [toggleOverview3d].
