/**
 * Shell initialization file management for OSC 7 cwd reporting.
 *
 * This file contains [ShellInitFiles], which configures shell environments
 * so that interactive shells emit OSC 7 escape sequences reporting their
 * current working directory. This enables [Osc7Scanner] to instantly detect
 * directory changes without polling.
 *
 * Called by [TerminalSession.create] (in Application.kt) when spawning a
 * new PTY process. The method [ShellInitFiles.configureEnv] injects the
 * appropriate environment variables before the shell starts:
 *  - **zsh**: redirects `ZDOTDIR` to a generated bootstrap dir that forwards
 *    the user's full login startup chain (`.zshenv`, `.zprofile`, `.zshrc`)
 *    and installs a `chpwd_functions` hook. Forwarding every phase — not just
 *    `.zshrc` — matters because zsh resolves all startup files from `ZDOTDIR`,
 *    so a `.zshrc`-only bootstrap silently skips `~/.zprofile` (where macOS
 *    users put `brew shellenv`, i.e. the Homebrew `PATH`).
 *  - **bash**: appends an OSC 7 emitter to `PROMPT_COMMAND`.
 *  - **fish**: no action needed (fish emits OSC 7 by default).
 *
 * @see Osc7Scanner
 * @see ProcessCwdReader
 * @see AppPaths

/**
 * Makes interactive shells emit OSC 7 cwd reports so [Osc7Scanner] can pick
 * them up. Most distros that ship VTE already do this; macOS bash/zsh do not.
 *
 * Strategy:
 *  - **zsh**: redirect ZDOTDIR to a generated bootstrap dir that forwards each
 *    phase of the user's real startup chain (`.zshenv` / `.zprofile` →
 *    `${'$'}{TERMTASTIC_REAL_ZDOTDIR:-${'$'}HOME}`), then in `.zshrc` restores
 *    `ZDOTDIR`, sources the real `.zshrc`, and registers a `chpwd_functions`
 *    hook. `.zlogin` is read from the restored real `ZDOTDIR` directly.
 *  - **bash**: append an OSC 7 emitter snippet to PROMPT_COMMAND.
 *  - **fish**: nothing — already emits OSC 7 by default.
 *  - **other**: nothing; the polling fallback in [ProcessCwdReader] still works.

     * Materialise the zsh bootstrap startup files into [dir].
     *
     * zsh resolves every user startup file (`.zshenv`, `.zprofile`, `.zshrc`,
     * `.zlogin`) from `$ZDOTDIR`. Because we redirect `ZDOTDIR` here, the
     * bootstrap must replay each phase of the user's real startup chain, or
     * those files are silently skipped. The one that bites on macOS is
     * `~/.zprofile`: it's where `eval "$(brew shellenv)"` typically lives, so
     * skipping it drops Homebrew from `PATH` (which in turn makes `vim` resolve
     * to a stripped system build, etc.). See [zshForwardContents].
     *
     * Phase handling:
     *  - `.zshenv` / `.zprofile` forward to the user's real files while
     *    `ZDOTDIR` still points here (so the next phase is also found here).
     *  - `.zshrc` restores `ZDOTDIR`, sources the real `.zshrc`, and installs
     *    the OSC 7 hook (see [zshRcContents]). Restoring there — not earlier —
     *    keeps the recursion guard for re-execing startup chains (p10k instant
     *    prompt, `exec zsh`, …) that historically lived in `.zshrc`.
     *  - `.zlogin` needs no bootstrap file: by the time zsh reaches it,
     *    `ZDOTDIR` is restored, so the user's real `.zlogin` is read directly.
     *
     * Extracted so tests can generate the bootstrap into a temp dir and drive a
     * real shell through it.

     * One subtlety: the canonical way users relocate their zsh config is to

     * file we re-pin `ZDOTDIR` back to the bootstrap and record the user's new
