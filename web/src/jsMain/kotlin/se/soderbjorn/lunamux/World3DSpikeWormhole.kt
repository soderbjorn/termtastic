/**
 * The **wormhole pane spawn** — the [WORMHOLE_SPAWN_ENABLED] birth cinematic that a
 * newly-created pane plays instead of the plain grow-in, the counterpart to the
 * phaser-fire close ([World3DSpikePhaser]). When a lone pane is born while the world is
 * open and the camera is idle, the camera swings off to a patch of open space to the
 * side, a **blue whirlpool vortex** spirals open there, and the new pane **emerges out of
 * it** — flashing into being, tumbling, then sailing to its ring slot while the rift
 * collapses shut behind it and the camera follows it home.
 *
 * The vortex ([buildWormholeVortex]) is a flat disc of **turbulent blue gas** (SVG
 * `feTurbulence` cloud) with a **dark eye** at its centre, on a three.js `Group` that is
 * billboarded then canted hard off the view axis so the round disc reads as a tilted
 * ellipse — the classic Star-Trek / Babylon-5 rift seen at a shallow angle. Two
 * counter-rotating cloud layers churn the gas into two swirling arms; the pane is born
 * out of the dark centre. All of it lives in ONE CSS3D plane — its `mix-blend-mode`
 * layers must never become CSS3D objects of their own, or Chromium flattens the whole
 * scene's perspective while they exist (see the one-plane rule in [buildWormholeVortex]).
 *
 * Two layers cooperate, as the phaser close's do:
 *  - the world-space **vortex** ([WormholeSpawn.funnel]) — billboarded to face the
 *    camera (plus a fixed cant), scaled open/shut, its cloud layers spun each frame; and
 *  - a **transform override** on the newborn [RingPane]: while [RingPane.spawnPhase] is
 *    live, [tickWormhole] fully rewrites the pane's world position / scale / opacity /
 *    rotation each frame — reading the ring slot the render loop *just* computed as the
 *    emergence destination, so the hand-off back to normal ring placement is seamless.
 *
 * Driven from the render loop's per-frame [tickWormhole] (called just *before*
 * `css.render`, since it moves real 3D objects); armed by [armWormholeSpawn] from
 * [reconcileRing]; torn down via [clearWormholes] on [closeWorld3dSpike].

/**
 * One **cloud layer** — a `<div>` (wrapping an inline `<svg>` so the CSS3D renderer, which
 * needs an `HTMLElement`, has one) filled with turbulent blue gas via SVG `feTurbulence`,
 * masked to a **two-arm spiral ring**: a radial mask carves the dark eye and feathered rim
 * while a soft conic mask concentrates the gas into two opposing arms, so it curls around
 * the centre like a whirlpool. `screen`-blended and blurred into wisps; spun by the tick.
 *
 * The turbulence is coloured by an `feColorMatrix` that fixes RGB to a blue and drives
 * alpha from the noise (then an `feComponentTransfer` gamma thins it to wisps).
 *
 * @param diameter layer diameter in px (world units at scale 1).
 * @param seed the `feTurbulence` seed (distinct per layer so they don't align).
 * @param baseFreq the `feTurbulence` base frequency (anisotropic → streaky gas).
 * @param octaves fractal-noise octaves (more = finer detail).
 * @param blurPx blur radius in px.
 * @param maskFrom the conic mask's starting angle (offsets the two arms per layer).
 * @return the cloud `<div>`.
 * @see buildWormholeVortex
