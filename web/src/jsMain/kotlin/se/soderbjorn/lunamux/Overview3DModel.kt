 *  - **All pane types:** tiles are pre-built with terminal / file-browser / git
 *    content by the core — just place `card.tiles`; don't special-case kinds.
 *  - **Both input modalities:** implement [nav] (keyboard) *and* [wheel] / [drag]
 *    / [click] (mouse/trackpad) so tabs and panes can be switched either way.
 *  - **Selection:** drive [ovSelected] (front tab) and [ovPaneSelected] (pane
 *    within it) through the shared [stepSelection] / [cyclePane] / [selectCard]
 *    helpers so [applyFidelity] and the title readout stay in sync.
