/**
 * The **demo movie** for the 3D world — a secret, demo-mode-only guided tour
 * (⌥⌘M) that "plays the keyboard" through a timed choreography showcasing the
 * spike, in the order a first-time viewer best reads it:
 *  1. **navigate** the panes of a tab (←/→) and the tabs themselves (↑/↓),
 *     resting on the red "waiting for input" agent along the way;
 *  2. **zoom** into the fronted window and back out (`+`/`−`/`0`);
 *  3. **resize its grid** — wider/taller and back (`.`/`,`/`>`/`<`), content
 *     reflowing live;
 *  4. **talk to Claude at a tilt** — tilt the camera off-axis (`j`), engage a
 *     *finished* Claude session (never a working or waiting one), type into it
 *     from the angle, and watch it pick the work back up;
 *  5. **shoot a window out of the sky** — the phaser-fire pane close (⌥X to
 *     arm, ⌥X to confirm);
 *  6. **stash a whole tab** to the shelf (⌃Space) and fly up to fetch it back
 *     (`v`, then ⌃Space at the dock);
 *  7. **grow a new window** through its wormhole (`n`);
 *  8. **travel to another world** — fly the camera *through* a wormhole to the
 *     next world (⌥⌘O); the whole rest of the tour plays out over there, in the
 *     DarknessIRC workspace's own tabs, panes and agents;
 *  9. **tour the new world's live windows** — walk the ring across a few of the
 *     DarknessIRC channels (#commodore, #kotlin-multiplatform, #amiga), resting a couple
 *     of seconds on each so the viewer reads that they are live IRC panes before
 *     the camera work begins;
 * 10. **overview → free flight** — frame the (new) world (`m`), drop into free
 *     flight (`f`), glide behind that world's *idle* Claude agent (`dirc-p9`,
 *     "claude: reconnect") and type into it from behind, "through the glass".
 *
 * **How it drives the app:** every beat that has a keyboard shortcut is played
 * as a *synthetic `KeyboardEvent` dispatched on `window`*, so it runs through
 * the real [buildKeyHandler] — the exact code path a human keypress takes.
 * That is deliberate: the shortcuts legend flashes its rows ([flashShortcut])
 * for every scripted press, mode badges appear, and the movie can never drift
 * from what the keys actually do. Only two things bypass the keyboard:
 *  - **typing** into an engaged terminal ([movieTypeInto]) feeds characters
 *    straight into the demo session's line discipline
 *    (`TerminalEntry.sendInput` → `DemoTerminalSession.inputText`), because
 *    xterm.js listens on its own hidden textarea, not on `window`;
 *  - the **fly-behind approach** ([playFlyBehindAndType]) calls [flyCamTo]
 *    directly to park behind a specific pane on another tab floor — there is
 *    no single-key "fly behind *that* window" shortcut.
 *
 * **Only ever types into a *finished* Claude** — in the home world the greets
 * pane ([DemoFixtures] `demo-s6`), and in the DarknessIRC world the idle
 * "claude: reconnect" agent (`dirc-s7`): the working panes (`demo-s1`,
 * `demo-s7`, `dirc-s4`) and the waiting ones (`demo-s4` plasma, `dirc-s6`) are
 * shown but never typed into, so the tour never puts words in a busy agent's
 * mouth. Each finished pane is woken at most once (a second message would land
 * on it mid-burst).
 *
 * **Timing:** beats use fixed pauses only for dramatic dwell; every camera
 * journey and ring settle is *awaited* ([movieAwait] on [spikeCamReturning] /
 * [spikeSettledIndex]) so the movie stays in sync on slow machines instead of
 * running ahead of its own animations.
 *
 * **Gating:** the movie only ever arms in demo mode ([isDemoClient]) — it
 * types into terminals and reorders panes, which would be vandalism against a
 * real server. The ⌥⌘M chord is checked in all three key-handler modes
 * (navigate / engaged / fly) so the tour can be stopped mid-beat; closing the
 * world ([closeWorld3dSpike]) also stops it.
 *
 * @see buildKeyHandler for the ⌥⌘M hook
 * @see DemoFixtures for the workspace the choreography is written against

 * The choreography itself — one linear pass through every showcase beat, in the
 * order a first-time viewer best reads the world: what a pane is → what the keys
 * do to it → the agent is *alive* → windows can be destroyed, stashed, born →
 * the world is a whole you can fly. Written against the demo fixture workspace
 * ([DemoFixtures.initialConfig]): the Compo tab fans a live `Claude Code`, a
 * build shell, and the finished `claude: greets`; the Trackmo tab holds the
 * red *waiting* `claude: plasma`; and the Assets/Delta tabs each pair their
 * viewer with a finished `claude: logo` / `claude: copper` we can safely wake.
 *
 * Every keyed beat goes through [moviePress] (→ real handler → legend flash);
 * see the file doc for why, and for the "finished panes only" typing rule.
 * Cancellation (⌥⌘M, Esc/close) lands in the caller's `finally`.
