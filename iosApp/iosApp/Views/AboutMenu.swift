//
//  Top-bar "About & links" overflow menu for the Lunamux iOS app.
//
//  Defines `AboutMenu`, the single info-button-plus-menu control shared by the
//  Hosts and Sessions toolbars. It gathers the app's external links (community
//  support forum, marketing website, and the legal pages) into one consistent
//  place on every primary screen, rather than duplicating them inline (and
//  risking drift) per screen. Mirrors the Android `AboutMenu` composable.
//

import SwiftUI
import Client

/// An info-icon toolbar button that reveals the app's external links.
///
/// Placed in the trailing toolbar of both the Hosts (`HostsView`) and Sessions
/// (`TreeView`) screens, it gives users a single, always-reachable entry point
/// to the support forum, the website, and the legal pages from either primary
/// screen. Tapping the icon opens a `Menu`; each row opens its URL in the
/// browser.
///
/// Keeping this a single view (rather than inline per screen) means the two
/// toolbars can never drift out of sync on which links they offer, and any new
/// link is added in exactly one place. Mirrors the Android `AboutMenu`
/// composable; the URLs are read from the shared Kotlin `LUNAMUX_*_URL`
/// constants (in `client`'s `ExternalLinks.kt`) via the generated
/// `ExternalLinksKt` accessor, so every platform points at one canonical
/// source and no URL is hardcoded here.

/// separate info button, while `AboutMenu` still wraps them in a standalone
/// info-button-plus-menu for the Hosts (`HostsView`) toolbar. Keeping the rows
/// in one view means the two entry points can never drift on which links they
