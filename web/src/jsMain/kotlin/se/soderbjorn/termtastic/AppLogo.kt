/**
 * App logo widget for the Termtastic web frontend.
 *
 * Renders the "Termtastic" wordmark and a small status dot pinned to the top
 * of the left (sessions) sidebar — see `TermtasticToolkitBootstrap.buildSidebarLogo`,
 * which wires it into the toolkit's `sidebarHeader` slot. The dot aggregates
 * all per-session states and (issue #38) is painted in the theme's foreground
 * colour — matching the per-row `.tt-status-dot` — instead of a fixed
 * green/red, so it meshes with any theme:
 *
 *   - waiting — at least one session is "waiting" (e.g. an agent is asking for
 *               input/approval). Waiting dominates because it needs action; the
 *               dot is swapped for a pulsing warning/exclamation triangle.
 *   - working — at least one session is "working" (agent is actively running)
 *               and none are waiting. The dot breathes (pulses) in place.
 *   - idle    — no session is working or waiting. A solid dot, no pulse.
 *
 * The shape (dot vs. triangle), not the colour, distinguishes the states now
 * that they all share the theme foreground colour — see `.app-logo-dot` in
 * styles.css.
 *
 * The logo brings back an older design element (see issue #14): a "Termtastic"
 * wordmark alongside a dot. In the previous incarnation the dot was to the left
 * of the wordmark and coloured by socket-connection status; this version moves
 * the dot to the right and ties it to work state, which is more informative for
 * day-to-day use.
 *
 * The logo is built in Kotlin (`buildSidebarLogo`) and slotted into the
 * sidebar header, so it scrolls/collapses with the sidebar. The dot element
 * keeps its `#app-logo-dot` id so [updateStateIndicators] can find and repaint
 * it on each server state push.
 *

/**

 * change), so the dot is always in sync with the per-row status indicators in
 * the sidebar and tab bar.
 *
 * Aggregation rule:
 *   1. If any session value is `"waiting"` → mark as waiting (pulsing warning
 *      triangle).
 *   2. Else if any session value is `"working"` → mark as working (breathing
 *      dot).
 *   3. Else mark as idle (solid dot, no pulse).
