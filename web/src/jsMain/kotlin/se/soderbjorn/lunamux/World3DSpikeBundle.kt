/*
 * Split from World3DSpike.kt — the "tab bundle" feature: unlisting a whole tab into the
 * spaceship as a merged stack of panes, and bringing it back.
 *
 * Where the stash feature ([World3DSpikeStash]) sends a *single* pane up to the dock shelf
 * (a 2D minimize), this feature sends a *whole tab* up to the **same shelf row**, sitting
 * alongside the single stashed panes as one merged stack, and unlists that tab in the 2D
 * world ([TabConfig.isHidden] via [WindowCommand.SetTabHidden]). Opt+V (in command center on
 * the front tab, or in free flight on the aimed pane's tab) triggers it; up at the dock the
 * stashed tabs are browsed among the stashed panes (←/→) and brought back down with Space
 * (the browsed item) or Opt+V (the nearest bundle).
 *
 * The visual is a pile of papers: on stash the whole tab is unlisted at once (so the command
 * center immediately stops enumerating it) and every pane flies to the location of the pane
 * the user selected, collapsing into a stack ordered by the tab's display order (first pane
 * on top / frontmost), each sheet offset slightly behind the one in front
 * ([bundleStackOffset]). Once merged the stack flies as one to its dock slot (reusing the
 * stash flight — the station door route [stashPanePath] and the camera flights
 * [flyStationEnter] / [flyCamTo]) and rests there merged. Unstashing flies the whole merged
 * stack back down before it separates — in original order, cascading — back onto the ring.
 *
 * Two channels, by design: a *pane* stash rides the toolkit `LAYOUT_STATE` `isMinimized`
 * flag ([persistPaneMinimized]); a *tab* unlist rides the server `WindowConfig`'s `isHidden`
 * flag ([WindowCommand.SetTabHidden]). So this file never touches [webSettingsPersister] /
 * `LAYOUT_STATE`; it sends a window command and lets the config broadcast sync every client,
 * reconciled inbound by [syncBundlesFromHidden].
 *
 * A committed bundle's panes are marked off-ring ([RingPane.tabOrd] = −1) so every
 * command-center navigation check — which filters panes by tab ordinal — excludes them
 * automatically, and [tickBundles] (called from [World3DSpikeRender]) owns their transform
 * end-to-end while [reconcileRing]'s death sweep spares them ([RingPane.bundleId]).
 *
 * See World3DSpike.kt for the module overview. Shared imports are carried verbatim; unused
 * ones are harmless (warnings, not errors).

 * Advances every [TabBundle] one frame and writes its panes' world transforms — the tab-bundle
 * counterpart of the render loop's per-pane stash placement. Called from [World3DSpikeRender]
 * after the per-pane loop (so it overrides the ring-slot placement of re-listed bundle panes)
 * and before the scene renders. Runs the MERGING/FLYING/PARKED/SEPARATING state machine, arms
 * the flight on merge completion, and on separation completion hands the panes back to the ring.
 *
 * @param camera the scene camera (unused today; taken for parity with [tickWormhole]).
 * @param selectedBundleId the id of the tab bundle currently **browsed at the dock**
 *   ([World3DSpikeRender] resolves it from the dock cursor), or `null`. Its every sheet is
 *   ringed with the dashed target outline so the whole pack reads as the selection; all
 *   other bundles' sheets have the outline cleared. A lone stashed pane's outline is handled
 *   by the render loop's [applyTargetOutline]; a parked bundle's panes are skipped there
 *   ([isParkedBundlePane]), so their outline is driven here instead.
