/**
 * Exposé-zoom style for the 3D tab overview — the "mission control" [Overview3DStyle].
 *
 * The design goal is *continuity with the real workspace*: the current tab's
 * panes start at their **actual** on-screen layout positions (read from each
 * [PaneTile.homeX]/[PaneTile.homeY], which the core computed from the pane's
 * fractional layout rectangle) and expand into a clean, tilted grid as the
 * camera pulls back. The other tabs cluster behind the grid and are revealed as
 * you zoom out. A single eased zoom parameter `t ∈ [0,1]` drives everything:
 * `t = 0` frames the working layout tight (only the current tab, at true layout
 * positions), `t = 1` is the pulled-back overview grid with the other tabs'
 * clusters visible.
 *
 * Motion (mirrors the CSS-3D reference, done as the three.js equivalent):
 *  - each current-tab tile lerps between its real-layout placement (t=0) and its
 *    grid slot (t=1); the whole group tilts (`rotation.x`) and the camera pushes
 *    back (`position.z`) as t grows;
 *  - the other tabs' clusters fade + slide in behind the grid as t→1;
 *  - the wheel/trackpad is a continuous zoom axis (the signature interaction);
 *  - while a dive is in progress the zoom snaps back toward the real layout so a
 *    picked pane "lands" in its working-layout position.
 *
 * Aspect ratio is preserved by **letterboxing**: a tile is never stretched to
 * fill its grid cell — it is scaled *uniformly* by `min(cellW/worldW,
 * cellH/worldH)` so its true [PaneTile.worldW]:[PaneTile.worldH] ratio is kept.
 * The layout/grid rectangles only ever decide a tile's *centre* and how much
 * room it has.
 *
 * As with the other styles, all content capture (terminal grids / file / git
 * thumbnails), selection state, and the open/close/render lifecycle live in the
 * shared core ([Overview3D.kt]); this file owns only the exposé's *spatial*
 * behaviour and gesture handling. The core builds [ovCards] and seeds
 * [ovSelected] / [ovPaneSelected]; this style parents the tile meshes into its
 * own group and animates them.
