/*
 * Split from World3DSpike.kt — pane grid sizing under the PTY-truth model.
 * See World3DSpike.kt for the module overview. Shared imports are carried
 * verbatim; unused ones are harmless (warnings, not errors).
 *
 * ## The PTY-truth sizing model
 *
 * A ring pane is a **truthful window onto its PTY**: the pane's pixel size is always
 * derived arithmetically from the terminal's grid (`cols × cellWidth`,
 * `rows × cellHeight` — [presentPaneToGrid]), never from DOM measurement. The PTY
 * grid is the *single size authority*; it only changes on an explicit user command:
 *
 *  - **grid keys** (`,`/`.` cols, `<`/`>` rows) add/remove cells directly
 *    ([growGridAxis] → [setPaneGrid] with `reassert = true`);
 *  - **`r` reformat** keeps the current grid — the pane's box *is* its grid, so a
 *    "fit to my screen" is identity — and **jiggles** the PTY one row out and back
 *    so the program gets real SIGWINCHes and repaints (a same-size pin is deduped
 *    end-to-end and reaches nobody); the pane's size ends where it started
 *    ([reformatPane]);
 *  - an **external client's resize** arrives as a `PtyServerMessage.Size` broadcast
 *    and flows through the same function with `reassert = false`
 *    ([applyMirrorSize] for mirrors, [spikeOnServerSize] for mounted panes).
 *
 * Opening the world is **PTY-neutral**: no fitting, no resize votes, no reformat —
 * panes appear at their true size. This replaced the old chain
 * (factor map → pixel box → FitAddon → DOM-measured "hug"), whose stale DOM reads
 * made panes fail to resize, jump size on reformat, and open blank.
