 * Arms a **cinematic camera tour**: an out-and-up Bézier flight from the camera's
 * current pose to [tx]/[ty]/[tz], facing [lookX]/[lookY]/[lookZ] the whole way, that
 * the render loop's [spikeCamReturning] tracer plays out over [frames] frames. The
 * generalized engine behind both the `c` return ([resetCamera] — fly home, face the
 * origin, land pristine) and a **stash flight** ([stashFront] — fly up to frame the
 * shelf, face the shelf, park flown). Snapshots the start pose, computes the apex
 * (midpoint of start→target pushed radially outward from the origin by
 * [CAM_RETURN_PULLOUT] and lifted +Y by [CAM_RETURN_RISE], so the arc pulls back to
 * reveal the scene then descends to land), and stores the target/look/land mode.
 *
 * @param tx/ty/tz the world pose the arc lands on.
 * @param lookX/lookY/lookZ the point the camera faces throughout the flight.
 * @param landPristine on arrival, `true` drops the camera to the pristine 1:1 default
 *   ([spikeCamFlown] = false, as `c` does); `false` leaves it parked at the flown target.
 * @param frames journey length in frames (~/60 s).
 * @param pullout how far the apex bulges radially out from the origin (arc width).
 * @param rise how far the apex lifts in +Y (the descend-to-land height).
 * @param followPaneId if non-null, the camera tracks that pane's live position instead
 *   of the fixed look point, keeping it centred through the flight. @see startSpikeLoop
 * @param sway horizontal bulge (world units, mid-flight) bowing the path sideways along
 *   the perpendicular of the straight start→target line; sign picks the side, `0.0` flies
 *   the classic in-plane arc. @see STASH_CAM_SWAY
 * @param roll max bank (radians) about the camera's own nose, `sin 2πs` profile — leans
 *   into the journey, unwinds, counter-banks, lands level. @see STASH_CAM_ROLL
 * @param landRoll a **permanent** bank (radians) the flight eases into and **holds** at
 *   landing — unlike [roll] it does not unwind, so the parked pose stays tilted. `0.0`
 *   lands level; the [flyOverview] hero shot sets it for the "slightly rotated" picture.
 *   @see spikeCamTourLandRoll
 * @param endLook if non-null, the aim eases from the in-flight look (fixed point or
 *   [followPaneId] pane) toward this point over the final [CAM_TOUR_END_BLEND] of the
 *   flight — swinging the gaze to frame the destination sign on touchdown while still
 *   tracking the pane on the way. @see spikeCamTourHasEndLook
 * @param then optional follow-on the render loop runs the frame this flight lands —
 *   chains a second leg onto the journey (the fly-through-the-door stash flights use it
 *   to sequence approach → transit → interior). @see spikeCamTourThen @see flyStationEnter
