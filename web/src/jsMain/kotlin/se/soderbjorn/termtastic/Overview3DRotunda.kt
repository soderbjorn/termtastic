/**
 * Rotunda style for the 3D tab overview — the "you stand inside a cylinder"
 * [Overview3DStyle].
 *
 * The whole overview is one tall rotunda you stand at the centre of. Each visible
 * tab is a **floor** of the building; that tab's panes are panels papered around
 * the cylinder **wall** at that floor's height. Two motions, one metaphor:
 *  - **Look around** the current floor — drag left/right (mouse / trackpad) or
 *    press `←`/`→` — spins the wall so the previous / next panel swings to face
 *    you; the panel dead ahead is the selection.
 *  - **Ride the elevator** between floors (tabs) — the wheel / a trackpad swipe,
 *    or `↑`/`↓` / `Tab` — glides you vertically to the previous / next floor,
 *    the wall re-papered with that tab's panes.
 *
 * Off-axis panels (turned away from you) and off-floor panels (above / below the
 * floor you're on) dim, so the panel you're looking at on the floor you're on is
 * always the brightest — mirroring the CSS-3D pitch's `cos(world)` squareness ×
 * floor-distance fade. Clicking a panel (or `Enter`) dives the camera through it
 * into the real tab; clicking empty space (or `Esc`) closes.
 *
 * Like every style, this file owns *only* the rotunda's spatial arrangement and
 * gesture handling; all content capture (live terminal grids, file/git
 * thumbnails), selection state, and the open/close/render lifecycle live in the
 * shared core ([Overview3D.kt]). The core builds [ovCards] and seeds
 * [ovSelected] / [ovPaneSelected]; this style parents the pane-tile meshes into
 * its cylinder group and animates the group (yaw = look-around,
 * `position.y` = elevator).
 *
 * True aspect ratio is preserved: each pane tile is letterboxed into a fixed
 * wall slot by a *uniform* scale ([SLOT_W]/[SLOT_H] via `min` of the two fits),
 * never stretched.
