/*
 * Split from World3DSpike.kt — the "stash" feature: sending panes up to a floating
 * shelf and bringing them back, each a cinematic camera journey.
 *
 * A pane you press Space on in navigate mode is **stashed**: added to [spikeStashed]
 * and flown up to the [stashShelfPos] of its slot on a shelf high above the sphere,
 * while the camera swoops up ([flyCamTo]) to frame the flight. Once the camera is up at
 * the shelf ([cameraAtShelf]), Space instead **unstashes** the shelved pane nearest the
 * camera — it sails back down to its original ring slot and the camera follows it home.
 * The stash toggle is camera-proximity-contextual so one key does both. While up at the
 * shelf, ←/→ **browse** the row ([shelfBrowse]): the camera glides flat from slot to
 * slot — the shelf counterpart of rotating the ring — so "nearest the camera" is always
 * the pane you parked at, no free-flying required (though pointing by free-fly works too).
 *
 * The actual pane motion is not driven here: [World3DSpikeRender]'s per-frame loop
 * lerps every pane between its ring slot and its shelf slot by its [RingPane.stashProg],
 * which eases toward 1 while the pane is in [spikeStashed] and toward 0 otherwise. This
 * file only mutates the stash *state*; the render loop animates it.
 *
 * See World3DSpike.kt for the module overview. Shared imports are carried
 * verbatim; unused ones are harmless (warnings, not errors).
