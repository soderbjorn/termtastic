/**
 * Carousel-ring style for the 3D tab overview — the original (and default)
 * [Overview3DStyle].
 *
 * Presents every visible tab as a card on a slowly turning 3D ring, camera at
 * the rim. The front card is the selection; as it settles at dead-centre it
 * dissolves into its individual pane tiles (one per pane, at the tab's real
 * layout geometry) which then ease apart, lift toward the camera, and bow into
 * a shallow inward curve. Rotating away reassembles them into the flat card.
 * Clicking the front card (or pressing Enter) dives the camera into it while the
 * overlay fades, landing on the real tab.
 *
 * This file owns only the carousel's *spatial* behaviour and gesture handling;
 * all content capture (live terminal grids, file/git thumbnails), selection
 * state, and the open/close/render lifecycle live in the shared core
 * ([Overview3D.kt]). The core builds [ovCards] and seeds [ovSelected] /
 * [ovPaneSelected]; this style parents the meshes onto its ring and animates
 * them.
 *
 * Interaction:
 *  - `←`/`→` (and a wheel/trackpad swipe along the dominant axis) rotate the
 *    ring one card at a time.
 *  - `↑`/`↓` / `Tab` walk the front tab's panes.
 *  - `Enter` or clicking the front card dives in; clicking a non-front card
 *    rotates it to front; clicking empty space (or `Esc`) closes.
