 * pane is settled (guard lives in [zoomFrontTo]).
 *
 * **Why measure instead of model.** An earlier version fitted the pane's *layout*
 * box (`offsetWidth/Height`) against the viewport, trusting a theoretical
 * "1 plane px == 1 screen px × zoom" identity and assuming the pane sits dead
 * centre. In practice both drift: the CSS3D perspective projection isn't exactly
 * 1:1 (title strip, glow, camera-distance rounding), and — more importantly — the
 * pane's projected centre is usually a touch *above* screen centre, so a symmetric
 * fit grows the pane until its **bottom rows clip off** the lower edge before the
 * top ever reaches the ceiling. So instead we read the pane's *actual* rendered
 * on-screen box ([getBoundingClientRect], which already bakes in the real CSS3D
 * transform) and fit *that*, about the box's true centre.
 *
 * A pane magnifies about its own projected centre, so the span that has to fit on
 * each axis is twice the distance from that centre to the *nearer* viewport edge —
 * `2·min(c, size−c)`. Dividing that room by the box's current projected size gives
 * the scale headroom, and multiplying the scale the box was measured at
 * ([obj].scale, the value that produced this frame's rect) by that headroom yields
 * the zoom that just fits. Self-correcting for both off-centre placement and any
 * projection drift, so the bottom rows stay on screen. Clamped to [ZOOM_MAX] by
 * [zoomFrontTo] like every zoom.
