/**
 * Realigns the `.xterm-viewport` DOM scroll position with the terminal
 * buffer's logical scroll offset (`buffer.active.viewportY`, i.e. xterm's
 * `ydisp`), fixing the desync that follows a detach/reattach of the pane's
 * DOM.
 *
 * Caller context: the toolkit caches each pane's content element by pane id
 * and *reattaches* the cached element whenever it re-renders — on tab
 * activation (the previously-hidden tab's panes come back into the tree) and
 * on every config push (the active tab's panes are reattached in place, e.g.
 * after a window refocus). The browser resets a scrollable element's
 * `scrollTop` to 0 whenever it is removed from and re-inserted into the DOM,
 * but xterm.js renders purely from its internal `ydisp`, so the grid keeps
 * showing the correct line (usually the latest output at the bottom) while the
 * native scrollbar silently sits at the top. The two are now out of sync:
 *
 *  - the first wheel-up does nothing (`scrollTop` is already 0),
 *  - the first wheel-down is read against `scrollTop == 0` and jerks the
 *    viewport to the top of the scrollback, and
 *  - [updateScrollButton] reads `viewportY == baseY` (not scrolled up) so the
 *    "New output" pill never appears.
 *
 * This restores `scrollTop = viewportY * cellHeight` — the exact value xterm's
 * own `Viewport._innerRefresh` would write — so the native scrollbar matches
 * the rendered content again. It works whether the user was at the bottom or
 * scrolled up into history (it keys off `viewportY`, not "at bottom"), is a
 * no-op when already aligned, and produces no visible jump: setting `scrollTop`
 * to precisely `ydisp * cellHeight` makes the resulting `scroll` event a
 * zero-delta no-op inside xterm. Runs independently of [TerminalEntry.autoReflow]
 * because scroll position is orthogonal to PTY sizing.
 *
 * Restoring `scrollTop` isn't enough on its own: the scroll *area* it moves
 * within can also be stale. PTY output keeps arriving while a tab is hidden, so
 * xterm's `Viewport._innerRefresh` runs those writes with the element's
 * `offsetHeight == 0` and sizes the scroll area one screen short; a same-size
 * switch never recomputes it, so the `scrollTop` set below would clamp a screen
 * above the bottom (first wheel-up jumps a screen, and you can't scroll back
 * down). So we call `syncScrollArea(true)` first to force a re-measure, and the
 * manual set just backstops it.
 *
 * Called from the per-pane `ResizeObserver` on each hidden→visible edge (tab
 * activation, where the container gains a non-zero size) and from
 * [renderConfig] after every config push (covers in-place reattaches — e.g.
 * window refocus — that keep the same size, so the `ResizeObserver` never
 * fires). Reads the same `_core._renderService.dimensions.css.cell.height`
 * path as [safeFit], and degrades to a no-op if those internals are absent.

/**
 * Writes PTY output to the terminal while holding the viewport on the *same
 * content line* when the user has scrolled up (auto-scroll "pause").
 *
 * The pause must keep what the user is reading completely still — not merely
 * stop short of the bottom. xterm.js already does this on its own while its
 * internal `isUserScrolling` flag is set, and it does so correctly in **both**
 * scrollback regimes (see `BufferService.scroll`):
 *
 *  - **Growing** (scrollback not yet full): each appended line increments
 *    `ybase` but leaves `ydisp` put, so the read line keeps its absolute index
 *    and stays on screen.
 *  - **Full** (scrollback at capacity): each appended line trims the oldest
 *    line off the top, so xterm *decrements* `ydisp` to track that shift and
 *    keep the read line stationary.
 *
 * The subtlety is that the correct anchor differs between the two regimes — the
 * absolute `viewportY` is stable only while growing; once trimming starts the
 * absolute index of the read line decreases every write. So we re-assert the
 * absolute `viewportYBefore` **only while the scrollback is still growing**
 * (`baseY` increased across the write). There it is both correct and useful: if
 * a write momentarily followed the bottom, scrolling back up to
 * `viewportYBefore` restores the line *and* re-sets `isUserScrolling` (a
 * negative `scrollLines` sets it) so subsequent writes stay pinned; when xterm
 * already held the line, the delta is 0 and this is a no-op.
 *
 * Once the scrollback is **full** (`baseY` unchanged), we must NOT re-assert:
 * re-anchoring to the now-stale absolute `viewportYBefore` would cancel out
 * xterm's per-trim `ydisp` decrement and march the viewport up one line per
 * write — the "tailing a live feed keeps scrolling away" bug. In that regime we
 * trust xterm's own compensation and leave the scroll position alone.
 *
 * When the user is at the bottom, output is written normally so the terminal
 * keeps auto-following the latest line.
