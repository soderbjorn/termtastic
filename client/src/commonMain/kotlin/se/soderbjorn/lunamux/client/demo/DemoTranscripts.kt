/**
 * Canned terminal content for demo mode: the initial scrollback transcript of
 * every demo PTY session, the shell prompt, the command→response tables used
 * when the user types into a demo terminal, and the timed output scripts
 * ([DemoScriptStep]) that make the Claude sessions look *live* — the two
 * "working" sessions loop a feed of tool calls and status-line ticks, the
 * finished session plays a one-shot work burst whenever the user talks to it,
 * and the ProTracker pane loops a playback feed (rows scrolling, VU meters
 * ticking) without ever being an "agent".
 *
 * Everything in this file is static — nothing is randomised at runtime, so
 * the demo looks identical on every load and on every client. All timestamps,
 * fake command output, and the simulated Claude Code sessions are authored
 * here; tweak this file to change what the demo shows. The fiction is an
 * Amiga demoscene production (see [DemoFixtures]): the shell is a modern
 * cross-dev box building 68k assembly with vasm, and the easter eggs
 * (`guru`, `load"*",8,1`) lean into it.
 *
 * @see DemoTerminalSession for the line-discipline simulation that replays
 *   these transcripts and answers typed commands
