/**
 * Process-lifetime, in-memory store for the Sessions screen's view-mode toggle.
 *
 * The Sessions screen on mobile (Android `TreeScreen` / iOS `TreeView`) can show
 * its tabs and panes either as a flat list or as the miniaturised "overview"
 * (thumbnails of the windows/panes). The user's choice of mode used to live in
 * per-screen view state ([androidx.compose.runtime.saveable.rememberSaveable] on
 * Android, `@State` on iOS), so it reset every time the user drilled into a pane
 * and navigated back to the Sessions screen.
 *
 * This singleton holds the toggle as a single boolean ([overviewMode]) for the
 * whole process so the choice survives navigation away from and back to the
 * Sessions screen. It is **deliberately memory-only**: it is not persisted to
 * disk (no [se.soderbjorn.termtastic.client.LocalStore] round-trip), so it
 * resets to the default (list mode) on the next app launch, exactly as
 * requested in issue #54.
 *
 * Both the Compose and SwiftUI front-ends read [overviewMode] when their
 * Sessions screen first appears and write it back whenever the user flips the
 * toolbar toggle. Each platform keeps its own `SessionsViewMode` enum for
 * rendering; this store only carries the underlying boolean so the two stay in
 * sync through the shared layer.
 *
 * @see se.soderbjorn.termtastic.client.viewmodel.OverviewBackingViewModel
