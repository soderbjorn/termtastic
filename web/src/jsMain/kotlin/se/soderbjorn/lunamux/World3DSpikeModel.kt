/**
 * One reparented pane on the ring. Most fields are `var` because a **mirror**
 * preview can be hot-swapped in place for the real terminal when its tab is
 * engaged (see [tryPromoteMirror]).
 *
 * @property paneId the pane (leaf) id. @property tabId the owning tab's id.
 * @property sessionId the backing session id (keys the `"working"` state map).
 * @property title/tabTitle strip labels. @property tabOrd the pane's tab ordinal.
 * @property paneOrdInTab the pane's index within its tab.
 * @property kind the pane's content kind. Non-[PaneKind.TERMINAL] planes carry a live
 *   git / file-browser DOM view instead of an xterm, so [term]/[fit] are `null` and the
 *   term-specific reformat/grid/zoom-font paths are skipped for them.
 * @property term the xterm on show (real registry term or owned mirror), or `null` for a
 *   git / file-browser plane.
 * @property fit the fit addon (to reformat), or `null`.
 * @property container the reparented element. @property wrapper the CSS3D plane.
 * @property dim the dim overlay. @property glow the "working" breath veil (pulsed each frame).
 * @property border the animated jagged "working" border (dash-offset run each frame).
 * @property previewTag the "preview" chip (mirrors), or `null`.
 * @property obj the [CSS3DObject] positioned each frame.
 * @property entry the real [TerminalEntry] if mounted, else `null` (mirror).
 * @property origParent/origNext where a real container came from (for restore).
 * @property mirrorSocket the preview socket for a mirror (closed on teardown), else `null`.
 * @property interactive `true` if the front pane can take keyboard input (real, mounted).
 * @property needsRefit `true` if [postOpenLayout] should reformat this pane.
 * @property baseFont/baseCw/baseCh native sizing, scaled with the font on zoom.
 * @property normScale side-pane normalization: the scale (≤ 1) that fits this pane's
 *   native box inside the common screen box ([spikeScreenW]×[spikeScreenH]), so a
 *   fullscreen-sized PTY can't dwarf the ring and slice through its neighbours'
 *   planes. Recomputed on every present; the front pane ignores it (1:1 PTY truth).
 *   @see presentPaneToGrid
 * @property birth the birth/death animation factor (0 = gone, 1 = full); the render
 *   loop eases it toward 1 (or 0 when [dying]) and multiplies the pane's scale by it,
 *   so a newly-created pane grows in and a removed one shrinks out. @see reconcileRing
 * @property dying `true` once the pane's backing pane/session is gone from the config
 *   and it is animating out; when [birth] reaches ~0 it is disposed and dropped.
